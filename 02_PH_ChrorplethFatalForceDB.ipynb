Thus, this type of map can be very useful to historians and other scholars.\n","\n","This lesson will demonstrate how the Folium library can be used to create choropleth maps quickly and easily. However, while a basic map is easy to create, they often require some adjustments to be as informative as possible. The level of complexity will increase as we move through the lesson. In an appendix, I included a discussion of how to normalize data (how to calculate \"X per 100K population\"); for many choropleth maps, this is an important step.\n","\n","At the end of the lesson you will be able to:\n","* Load several types of data from web archives\n","* How to associate latitude/longitude points with county names, geography, and FIPS numbers\n","* Create a basic choropleth map\n","* Reflect on some issues that map-designers need to consider, especially the problem of dealing with non-normal distributions of data\n","* Enhance a Folium map with titles, popup data, and mini-maps.\n","* One issue with choropleth maps that display data about people is that this data tends to correlate closely with population centers; in the appendix, I will show how this issue can be addressed.\n","\n","We will be exploring the *Washington Post*'s [Fatal Force](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings) database. Starting in 2015, the *Post* started the database, which seeks to document every time an encounter with a police officer ends in the death of the civilian. This data isn't collected or reported systematically, so the *Post*'s work fills an important lacuna in our understand of how police interact with the people around them.\n","\n","My comments will reflect the data in the database as of April, 2023.
