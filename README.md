# DataAnalysisClass
This repo is a collection of files to be used for an introduction to digital humanities / data analysis class to be taught in Spring 2024

Most of the notebooks are hosted on Google's colab system, since all students will have access to it from their college accounts. But I will be hosting some datafiles on Git, because it is easier to read data from Git then to use colab!
